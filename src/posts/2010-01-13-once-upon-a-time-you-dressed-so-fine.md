In honor (not really) of Pepsi Throwback, I am doing my own little set of &#8220;throwbacks&#8221; and posting some really old stuff. Kinda funny, going through 3,000+ pictures from my old point-and-shoot Canon SD450.

First set here are from a trip to Mississippi to help with hurricane relief efforts when I was a part of campus life. This was really sort of a life-changing trip, but not in the usual way and not something I realized until recently. It wasn&#8217;t so much the destruction and the trip&#8217;s goal itself that changed me, it was that I first realized that photography (and videography) can be used to tell a story. The Daily Herald (probably the start of my endearing love for that paper) sent a reporter and a photographer down with us. I got a chance to talk with Laura Stoecker, the photog that went down, a bit here and there and it was really the first time I had ever heard of &#8216;photojournalism&#8217;. Sort of that little seed was planted and I was hooked.

That last one of my little sisters from 2006 cracks me up. They both look soooooo pissed. Maggie on the right (she&#8217;s 12 now!!) and Rachel on the left (9??!).

So here was a little look at 2006. What I wouldn&#8217;t give to be able to go back on that trip to Mississippi with a legit camera and experience.. Looking through the 1,200 pictures I took down there, I couldn&#8217;t help but laugh at where I choose to shoot from. Lots of the backs of people&#8217;s heads and such. It was also funny to see how much I had learned in a week; pictures from the last half of the trip were still LEAGUES better then the first half. Still not great of course. Lolz.
