Howdy!

My internship is nearly over :-(. Monday is the last day. At some point next week I am going to make a portfolio post, somewhere around 20 images from the entirety of the experience. In all reality, there will be a goodly amount of duplicates, but I think it will still be worth posting so you can see the best of the summer! I&#8217;m going to sit down with a few of the other photographers in the office. But here are some from the last few days. Enjoy!<figure style="width: 495px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

Well that about does it! Big stuff on the horizon, lets see where things go! Now if only I could figure out how to wake up in the mornings&#8230; <img src="http://kshermphoto.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
