Hello all!\
Getting into the finals season for basketball. These are the games that are fun to photograph! Well, it seems that Hampshire High School was really dark last night so I ended up using my 5D Mark II with the 70-200 and using my new 35 f1.4L since the nice and big aperture will make cleaner photos with the 1D Mark III. You really can use any lens for sports (all depends on what you're shooting of course), the 35L can create a little bit different image. The 5D Mark II's auto focus is pretty slow and not all that responsive, but worked well enough.<figure id="attachment_894" style="width: 686px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

^ This image is why I'm excited about a full-frame sports camera. The 1D X or the rumored improvements to the 5D Mark III/X are going to be really really nice.<figure id="attachment_896" style="width: 900px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
