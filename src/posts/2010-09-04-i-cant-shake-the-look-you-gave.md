Heelllllloooooo again. Sports are comin&#8217; back! That means it&#8217;s almost Fall <img src="http://kshermphoto.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" />

Well, I did it. I finally got myself my very own Canon EF 300mm f2.8L. Thing of beauty. The bottom 4 images were shot with it and my newly repaired 1D Mark III. Good fun, wish I could have shot the whole game, deadlines!
