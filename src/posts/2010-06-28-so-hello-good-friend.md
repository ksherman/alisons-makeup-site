Few left overs from Cali.

  Little sisters and my grandpa takin' a gander at a sea otter. Cute little baggerts!

<p style="text-align: center;">
  La Brea Tar Pits, Los Angeles. These are life-size statues of mammoths just outside the George C. Paige Museum. It both cracks me up insatiably and saddens me. Bye daddy!

  Oh noes! A meteor! Also equally hilarious and saddening. Good thing they were captured in stone/plaster for eternity/a few decades.

  Mom discharged from the hospital after only two and a half days!

  Whoop!

Okay... Well I've been back from California for a long while now. Despite the early set backs and last-minute surgery plan changes, everything went off without a hitch! The surgery only lasted a few hours and they were able to determine definitively that the tumor was not cancerous and was a benign tumor (still growing, but benign!). Crazy birthday.

The post-op was only a few days in the hospital and she was feeling pretty good afterwards, well considering. That anesthesia takes a while to fully leave your system I guess.

Lil' brother Eric came in on Thursday the 3rd. Drove around LA. Hated the driving, wished to be back home.Travels home were okay, except I got stuck in the cliche seating arrangement on the airplane... Ugh.

Another, newer, image to come shortly with more ruminations. Stay tuned, as they say in the biz.
