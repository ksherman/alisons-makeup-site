Another Throwback post! This time, from 2007!

This is actually one of the first images I ever took with a digital SLR. I had gotten a Canon EOS 20D about halfway through my film photography class after being frustrated with the whole developing process. I just wanted to shoot without worrying about wasting money and time on film… Someday maybe I'll get an old Leica film camera, otherwise I don't plan to shoot film ever again.</em>

    Another stroll down Compact Flash Memory lane! There are a TON of pictures from the early days of VIP that I didn't post, mostly the beginnings of my Sports Action days. While this year wasn't formative/epiphany ridden like 2006 was, BUT this year I learned a truck load about how to use my camera. I started shooting for Visual Image Photography, based out of Wisconsin in 2007 as well, which meant that I was getting paid to take pictures. This was HUGE, it let me buy new and better gear eventually and got me shooting a lot more than if I wasn't working for them. They also put me in a wide variety of situations and I did a lot of learning  on-the-job which is my favorite. All-in-all, 2007 was a hoot!
