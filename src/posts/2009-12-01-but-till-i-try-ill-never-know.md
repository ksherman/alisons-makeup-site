ANGEL STREET!

I have actually had these pictures edited a long time ago. Been crazy crazy busy or scattered and haven&#8217;t gotten these up yet&#8230; There is quite a number of these baggerts, so here are a small selection of 4 images, followed by a slide show with more for your enjoyment.

Part of the cast, crew etc? Download the set <a href="http://storage.kshermphoto.com/Judson/AngelStreetPixels.zip" target="_blank">here</a> (141MB).

This week&#8217;s title was taken from the song &#8220;Defying Gravity&#8221;, both from the musical &#8216;Wicked&#8217; and also performed on the TV Show &#8216;Glee&#8217;.
