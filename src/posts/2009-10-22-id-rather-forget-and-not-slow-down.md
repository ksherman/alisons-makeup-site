Hello!

Boo for not posting in such a long time. This has been a pretty nuttsy month. There are a lot of photos on the way, so expect your mind to explode. In fact, I'm splitting it up into a few posts, two tonight. This first one will be a mix of various assignments from the last several months. Then, the next post will be all from a football game from last Friday. So here we go!<figure style="width: 800px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
