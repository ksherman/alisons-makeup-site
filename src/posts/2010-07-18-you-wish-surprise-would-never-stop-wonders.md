So this is ***not*** a post of ***my work***, but of the videographer [Chris James][1] that put together this highlights video from my brothers wedding. This guy is a machine, I'm stunned he's already got this edited together! Talked with him for quite a while while getting high off a cheap cigar. He's talented and a geek, stellar combination, I do say! Few clips of me in there too.



Great work Chris!

And congrats again to the bro and his gal.

Peace

Today's title, and the song used in the video, are from the song "Go Do" by Jónsi from his album Go. Love that song.
