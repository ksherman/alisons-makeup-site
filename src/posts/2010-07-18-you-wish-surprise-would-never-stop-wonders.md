So this is ***not*** a post of ***my work***, but of the videographer [Chris James][1] that put together this highlights video from my brothers wedding. This guy is a machine, I&#8217;m stunned he&#8217;s already got this edited together! Talked with him for quite a while while getting high off a cheap cigar. He&#8217;s talented and a geek, stellar combination, I do say! Few clips of me in there too.



Great work Chris!

And congrats again to the bro and his gal.

Peace

Today&#8217;s title, and the song used in the video, are from the song &#8220;Go Do&#8221; by JÃ³nsi from his album Go. Love that song.
