Sometimes I get bored with my own images. I know nearly every one of them, remember the situations I was in when I took the image, the camera I used and all that. It isn&#8217;t often that I am surprised by one of my own pictures.

I have a folder of pictures that rotate on my desktop so I don&#8217;t get bored with the same background. This is an image that I took way back in July and just processed the other day with the beta of Lightroom 3. I just exported and tossed it in the desktop folder. Just yesterday, it popped up for the first time. I surprised me. It stopped me. I don&#8217;t know what it is about it, but I love it! So that&#8217;s it. Here it is (you can click it for a larger version too, if you are so inclined):

In the next few days, I have a lot more to show! Thanks for being patient, busy time of the year.
