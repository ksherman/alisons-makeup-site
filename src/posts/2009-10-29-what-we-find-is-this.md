  I had the pleasure of shooting John Ritchey and Mandy Rivera a few weeks back. I have been crazy-busy so I had to get through them in my &#8216;spare&#8217; time while both jobs are asking me to put in more hours&#8230; hahahahaha.

      Now to get through the wedding stuff! Going to bust a move straight through them, cull the junk and out a few up. Football Friday night and probably Saturday. Play-off season! Shoot, I have another football game to post here&#8230; I can do those now!

      Additionally, I am beginning to put together an application for a summer internship with the Associated Press. Crazy selective, something like two people for the whole country. Nervous. But looking forward to going through the process.
