Only two pictures for today's post, both from our crazy day of snow on Saturday. I wish we had those more often. Now its just going to become brutally cold some more. Blegh.<figure style="width: 800px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

I can't even imagine the things I can do when I get the opportunity to shoot full time. I feel right now that time is so tight, better now that school is over, but only shooting a few hours here and there is frustrating. Been shooting a ton of basketball, good fun and all but I'm yearning for something a little different. So many thing I want to learn how to do, but seems I don't have sufficient opportunities. Guess this is that quarter-life crisis John Mayer sings about. Nice.

A lot of changes coming up, maybe this is an opportunity to put a new step forward, and make happen the things I want to happen. Woot.

Something new: reading for fun and not reading Tom Clancy. I LOVE Tom Clancy books, well the Jack Ryan series anyway. I have read many of them twice, that good. Incidentally, those are pretty much the only books I have eer read for fun. Well, for the last week or so I have been reading a Stephen King book, Duma Key. Its a long one, so this will be rough to finish. My first Stephen King too, its good fun. May sound silly, but thats a bit of step in my book; something new. Thanks Ashley for recommending it!

Anywhoose, I am sure no one reads these parts any way! Could be the last post of the year, but no promises. After I move, I'm going to be looking at actually putting together galleries of pictures. I had hard drive issues about 8 months ago and haven't fully recovered, organizationally. I actually just discovered yesterday that I have lost nearly all my Israel pictures. Only saving grace was that I gave out a few DVDs to the other team members. But that means all my panoramics are gone. Ah well. Needless to say I have two copies of all my pictures locally and am about 4 days away from a complete online backup.
