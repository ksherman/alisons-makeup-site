Hello all!

Been crazy out-of-my-mind the last few weeks, lots going on... But more on that some other day! Instead, to whet your appetites, I have some aerial photographs! Most of these are of Judson University, but not all! Everything looks sooooo cool from 1,000-1,200 feet! Only wish the sun had peaked from the clouds more while we were up and that the windows weren't so cloudy. But it was still a fun experience!

Note: some of these might take a little longer to open, trust me, it's worth it!
