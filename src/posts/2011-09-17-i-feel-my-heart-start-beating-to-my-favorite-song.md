Got to shoot some golf today! Especially on a day like today, it&#8217;s a lot of fun to cruise around a golf course in a cart, taking in the sights and taking some pictures. This was a little tougher of an assignment, as I had to get coverage for three papers and I took too many pictures (ha! what else is new :P).

Moved offices at my full-time job and I now have my own office! Pretty cool, but I need to figure out some cool ways to decorate and fill the space. Everyone else in the office seems full of ideas, interior decoration is not my thing :P. Till next time!

Today&#8217;s title is from the new Coldplay song &#8220;Every Teardrop Is A Waterfall&#8221;. This song is best listened to while driving with the windows open!
