### The Project
* Weekly meet ups
* Version Control - Git
* Gitlab Issues
* Pull Requests and Code Reviews
* Accessibility: Bootstrap (sr-only classes) + ngAria (AngularJS library)
* Student Feedback
	* Very positive response
	* 20 person user groups
	* Used the survey to iterate and improve. 
* Other Uses
	* Recruitment Tools (could show prospects the courses they offered)
	* Each campus wants their own unique search. 
* Challenges:
	* Relevance or Course Number?
	* Dropdowns?
	* Why isn't my course first?
	* Let the data speak - use analytics, not your opinion. 
	* Not yet launched
