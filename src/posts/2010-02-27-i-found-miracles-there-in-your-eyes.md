[insert obligatory apology for not posting in a while here&#8230;]

Yellow Smith! How are you? That&#8217;s good. Me? Oh, where do I start? Hmm, good idea, I should post some pictures from the wedding of [John and Mandy Ritchey][1] (follow the link to their engagement pictures!) that I just finished shooting earlier today!

It&#8217;s been a long time since I last shot a wedding solo. Was a little anxious the day before, but once by the time I left this morning, I didn&#8217;t feel like I was forgetting anything, which was pretty awesome. I always seem to have that feeling. And I ended up having a great time, even with the really really really tight morning schedule. I&#8217;m pretty happy with the day&#8217;s events. However, I am not happy with the focusing speed of the Canon EF 16-35mm f2.8L. Further evidence that I should trade up my 24-105 f4L IS for the 24-70 f2.8L&#8230; But the IS of the 24-105L really can be useful for video. What evs.

So, what&#8217;s been going on since I last posted? A LOT. Been super busy with work at the shop for a change and its driving me slightly crazy and making me super busy. Which, come thing of it, its been over a month since I posted. Where the crap did February go!?!!!?!!!? I&#8217;ve actually been shooting a decent amount, but just haven&#8217;t gotten around to popping up a post.

I sold my 5D and my 1D Mark II and picked up a 1D Mark III in replacement. Just got it on Friday, used it a ton at this wedding. In fact, all but three of these came from the Mark III. Really really liking it.

Other big news is that I got &#8220;accepted into the [DePaul University] MA in Journalism program by the unanimous and enthusiastic vote of the graduate board in journalism. That now sets a land speed record in the shortest time it has taken between a candidate submitting his credentials and the graduate board acting,&#8221; at 1:33am February 26th. Woop! I start around the end of March and I am super excited. Its a pretty slick program.

You know, I had intended to write a whole bunch here, but my brain is really super scattered right now. So, that&#8217;s it! I&#8217;m done.

Today&#8217;s title comes to you from the song &#8220;Needle and Haystack Life&#8221; by Switchfoot from their recent album Hello Hurricane. Mind blowing album. These guys just can&#8217;t write a bad song.
