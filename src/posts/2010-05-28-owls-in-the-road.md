Nope, it&#8217;s not the name of an Owl City cover band.

Or part of the chorus of a song.

They are signs of God&#8217;s hand on my mom and dad (and family) along their journey to rid the world of brain tumors, one person at a time. Or something like that.

> We later decided to coin the term &#8220;Owl in the Road&#8221; for any event of significance, an epiphany moment, or a &#8220;sign&#8221; (not necessarily a crop circle like in Midnight Shama-lamma&#8217;s movie).
> 
> As we go through this ordeal we try to look for God&#8217;s healing hand upon our hearts. Sometimes He speaks to us and comforts us through our relationships with other people, sometimes it is through events that make us gasp and say &#8220;No one but God our Creator could have done that.&#8221; Some call them &#8220;signs&#8221;, some say they are &#8220;just coincidences.&#8221; To us its an &#8220;Owl in the Road.&#8221;

This is an excerpt from the blog my dad is maintaining along this journey. Check it out here:

Should be a good read, my dad&#8217;s quite the writer.

I had my own little adventures getting. I apparently book a flight for 5:18pm FRIDAY night, not Thursday. My mom&#8217;s surgery was scheduled for Friday. Smoooooth. Luckily I was able to get on a flight last night to still get to Cali before the operation. Whew! Second obstacle: waiting in O&#8217;Hare for 5 hours before the flight would take off. Fortunately [DeeDee K.][1] was on hand for entertainment! Thanks for making it an enjoyable wait!

So pictures. Here&#8217;s some.
