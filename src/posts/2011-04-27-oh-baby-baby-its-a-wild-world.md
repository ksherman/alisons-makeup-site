So&#8230; I haven&#8217;t really talked much at all about this on the blog, so this maybe be a small surprise&#8230;

On March 19, 2011 I got married to my best friend and coolest person in the world, Alison Ivy Mojica. I&#8217;ll post some pictures from that day soon. My photographer is the second coolest person and the world and a great guy to hang out with, [Robb Davidson. He&#8217;s one talented baggert. Hire him, for real.][1]

Next part of the story? (Don&#8217;t worry, there so much to tell)

We just had a baby on Monday, April 25, 2011 at 6:22 p.m.

But the saga began on Friday night. Alison started contractions in pre-labor at 11 p.m. and it didn&#8217;t pick up until Sunday morning. We went to Sherman Hospital at 7 a.m.ish, but Alison didn&#8217;t have much progress and we went home to labor some more. She finally started picking up and we returned at 8 p.m.. Unfortunately, the labor stalled again and Alison stayed dilated at 7cm for nearly 12 hours. She worked so hard, but ultimately a cesarean section was required and baby Annabella Ivy Sherman was born at 6:22 p.m., at 7 lbs 6 ozs and 21&#8243; long after laboring for nearly 36 hours.
