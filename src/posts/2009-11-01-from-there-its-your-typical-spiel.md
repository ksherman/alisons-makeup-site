Hello!

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Playoff season is here for high school football! Because three different school share the same field, I got to shoot a Saturday afternoon game. It was pretty overcast, but it was sooooooo nice shooting ISO200 and still getting shutter speeds over 1/2000th! Got some sweet shots.

This week's title was taken from the song "Deathbed" by Relient K from their album Five Score And Seven Years Ago. This is a mind-blowing and epic song.
