  Hello everyone!
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Sorry for the delay in posting something new. I had a crisis were I managed to lose all the data on my external hard drives, while at the same time being overwhelmed with some school work and many many shoots. In one day I took nearly 8GB of pictures.. I finally have a moment to breathe and start getting organized again.

  These are from an assignment I had to try and get images of Student Life at HD Jacobs High School last Friday. Our contact wanted me to take pictures during their lunch hours, which on paper sounds like a silly and creepy idea. Turns out it was more fun than I expected and the students seemed to have fun with it.
