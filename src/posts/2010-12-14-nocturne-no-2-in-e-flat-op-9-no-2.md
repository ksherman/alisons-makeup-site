Hello readers!

I know, I know. No posts in a loooooooong while. Here is a first sampling of some work I&#8217;ve been doing for the Gery Chico for Mayor of Chicago campaign.

Some more posts are on the way, for realsies.

Today&#8217;s blog title is from a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGRO05WcNDk" target="_blank">Chopin song</a>. It&#8217;s busy and chaotic, but beautiful all the while. I can&#8217;t think of any better way to describe the last two months.

Since I started with the Gery Chico campaign in mid-October, Chico went from being one of the many other candidates running against Rahm Emmanuel, to easily being the number two candidate in the race. Don&#8217;t worry about polls this early, it&#8217;s just getting started! I really really wish I could spend more time working with the campaign. It&#8217;s a blast, I want more.

I also closed on a house in October. Yup. West-side of Elgin, near Wing Park. Bit of a fixer-upper (understatement), probably wont be able to move in until late January or so. I&#8217;ve got some early photos to scare you with.

I also started dating (more accurately, falling in love with) the lovely Alison Mojica. She was my first-ever crush in middle school, waaaaay back. Since then we&#8217;ve been good friends, I always was able to turn to her during rough times in life. Without being too dramatic, she&#8217;s literally changed my life in just two months. She&#8217;s the one. Rough times are ahead, but I know we can lean on each other to make it through.

Well, I&#8217;ll have some more goodies for you in the near future (read: this week)!

Peace
