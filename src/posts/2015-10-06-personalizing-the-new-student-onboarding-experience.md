* Onboarding without Waterboarding (hahaha)
* Why: the common goal is to move admitted students to matriculated students -- to get them to board our train.
* Change from a static site to a more dynamic and relational site. 
* Solution Key Tenants
	* Create our own private Facebook groups
	* Create a device-agnostic website
	* Centralize communication
	* feature their personal counselor
* High School student Confusion: how do students want to be communicated to during the onboarding process? A personalized portal experience

### Phase 1
* Create a private Facebook group
	* establish community
	* increase relational touch points
	* got good participation
* Some hurdles:
	* Normal vs App/Game group (used App/Game group)
	* You cannot just add users, the user has to authorize this action.

### Phase 2
* Communication and Personalization
* Mapped out the rough wireframe and task flow
	* Four basic sections: quicklinks to resources, their admissions counselor, announcement section, then the personalize to do list of tasks.
* Incorporated most of the original ideas into final product
* Support for task dependencies
* Tasks can be delivers on certain criteria (commuter, etc.)
* Tasks that can autocomplete
* Created layouts

* Ending: Pilot Group: Selection of incoming students that we knew would come even if their MyCedarvill experience bombed. 

### Phase 3: Production
* Surveyed the incoming class that went through the application.
* Many of the students that came to campus ended up using the portal often. 
* Half gave their login to their parents.
* Most connected with the Facebook group.
* Email, Postcard and Texts were used to encourage people to log into the portal. Email was the most responded to and viewed as the most helpful. 
* Overall, the response was positive to the portal.
* Communication plan phased in the tasks (so they weren't all in there at the start).

### Version 2 and What's Next
* Added more Google Analaytics event tracking
* Expanded to handle future terms more gracefully. 
* Expanded to handle no valid applications.
* Starting much earlier (fall instead of winter).
* Rework the UI and backend (aiming for AngularJS and API which will enable a mobile app).
* Broaden the types of notifications they can send (Facebook/Twitter/Text/Push/etc.)

### Key Takeaways
* Integrate Social media at a deeper level
* Increase relational touch points
* Evaluate data that can be personalized
