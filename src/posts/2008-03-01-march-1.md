Hey to all you blogging types out there&#8230; I REALLY want to get on this photo-a-day bandwagon. For the most part, I have used Xanga for that, so I have been hesitant to start another blog somewhere else..

but sometimes its good to start again somewhere new.

So yesterday I got some sweet goodies. Got me a 24&#8243; Samsung LCD Monitor. This is one sweet display, without getting too technical, it is capable of displaying well over twice the colors as my MacBook Pro&#8217;s screen. Before getting this puppy, I thought my laptops display was the best one I had ever used. Sure those 30&#8243; Apple displays at Linder are nice, but they are not this bright or clear, thats for darn sure!! Now I have a nice two dispaly setup&#8230; This should help with post-processing now that I have a more color accurate monitor.

As a result, there are now as many as 5 cables coming off my laptop. Audio, Power, Monitor, External Hard Drive and then a USB connection going to a 4Port USB Hub in the back of my monitor, which is also filled <img src="http://kshermphoto.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" />

Got my tablet, keyboard, memory card reader and Printer all connected&#8230;

Invaluable to cloning and other detail work in Photoshop&#8230;

<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.kshermphoto.com/Misc/Blogger/Desk-4.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 400px;" src="http://www.kshermphoto.com/Misc/Blogger/Desk-4.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>

My nearly-full 500GB External Hard Drive&#8230; Hides nicely behind the monitor.

Yes, I know, its not an Apple Keyboard.. Maybe someday I will try one, but I tried one of these out at Best Buy and love the way it feels. Plus, it has the Apple keys too, which is nice. Besides, Logitech makes great products too! I would NEVER use an Apple mouse, especially if I have my Logitech mouse in my backpack <img src="http://kshermphoto.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />

Well, that about rounds it up! Hopefully the first of many to come. Plus, I go to Israel in 5 days, so there will be plenty of pictures!
