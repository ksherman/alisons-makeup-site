It's been a while since I've posted. Staying busy! Changed jobs (I'm the Webmaster at Benedictine University now), shooting a lot of weddings with my friend Robb, Annabella is growing pretty fast and I've almost completely switched back to PCs (\*shudder\*). I've got a few more posts to throw your way. Oh yeah, and you've probably noticed that I changed my site's template again. Fun!

For now, today's post has a few new pictures from a trip to Galena. I took another stab at at some long exposure star trail photos. This time I was able to use a remote shutter release instead of taping down the button with duct tape. After those, there's a shot of a a farm I've always wanted to snap a picture of, this last trip the clouds in the sky were awesome!

Thanks for looking, there's more to come!

Peace\

Today's title is from the Imagine Dragons track "Radioactive" on their album Night Visions. Love this album.
