It&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve posted. Staying busy! Changed jobs (I&#8217;m the Webmaster at Benedictine University now), shooting a lot of weddings with my friend Robb, Annabella is growing pretty fast and I&#8217;ve almost completely switched back to PCs (\*shudder\*). I&#8217;ve got a few more posts to throw your way. Oh yeah, and you&#8217;ve probably noticed that I changed my site&#8217;s template again. Fun!

For now, today&#8217;s post has a few new pictures from a trip to Galena. I took another stab at at some long exposure star trail photos. This time I was able to use a remote shutter release instead of taping down the button with duct tape. After those, there&#8217;s a shot of a a farm I&#8217;ve always wanted to snap a picture of, this last trip the clouds in the sky were awesome!

Thanks for looking, there&#8217;s more to come!

Peace

Today&#8217;s title is from the Imagine Dragons track &#8220;Radioactive&#8221; on their album Night Visions. Love this album.
