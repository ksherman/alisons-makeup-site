Hey, sorry I don&#8217;t have anything new to post. I just ordered some new equipment, so be looking forward to some new stuff!

I bought a Canon 1.4x Extender, a Male to Male PC sync cord (time to get that flash off the camera!) and a 45&#8243; Umbrella for my flash. Should be a grand ol&#8217; time!

I am shooting another baseball game this Saturday (weather is going to be sucky) and hopefully the Extender would help a ton.
