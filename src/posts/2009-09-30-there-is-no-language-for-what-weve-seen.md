Hello to all my faithful viewers!

Another round of newspaper assignments last weekend. Nearly forgot to post! As always, schedule crazy, but this last weekend got to see Owl City in concert at the Rave in Milwaukee. Was quite an incredible show. The opening acts, I have my various reasons for not really getting into them, but was pleasently surprised by Owl City. I half expected it to just be the lead singer, a laptop and a keyboard. But, he had a drummer, backup vocals (also on keyboard), a cellist and and violinist. Was really neat knowing that everything we heard was played on stage, not to a track (which is most of my issue with the opening acts). Good fun!

No camera yet. Was hoping to get my 7D this week, but I guess I took too long to pre-order and might have to wait until early next week. I cannot tell you how bummed I am. Never pre-ordered something this awesome before, the waiting is the hardest part.

Small change to the blag: I change the home page only to show the three most recent posts, instead of five. This should help my site load faster if you are on a slower internet connection and will be a big help to those few the happen upon me from a mobile device. Five posts makes for a very very long page with several photos in each. Enjoy!

See you next week! Or maybe sooner, never know...

Peace\
