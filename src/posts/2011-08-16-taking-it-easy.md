Lots of changes coming at work. Mostly good. I don&#8217;t fear change, but if I don&#8217;t understand what&#8217;s coming, I can become skeptical. Couple that was the condition of the economy, mostly lame candidates in the 2012 GOP primary (I love politics!) and that can add up to a lot of uncertainty.

This guy helps run a bed and breakfast tucked in Geneva of 38. I wonder what it&#8217;s like to get to that age where you&#8217;ve seen it all and finally get to relax and run a B&B.

So stay classy, kick back and take it easy once in a while. Also, shooting at f1.4 allowed me to shoot at ISO800 instead of ISO3200. Time for primes. But need money. Someday!
