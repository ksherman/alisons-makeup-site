Hello. A lot has been going on the last few weeks. Life and Love and Why.

Haven't had very much of an opportunity to shoot for fun or for much of anything. I tried something a little different a while back and am getting around to uploading some random work of late.<figure style="width: 533px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.kshermphoto.com/2009PostsImages/May/17/Flower-001.jpg" alt="Flower" width="533" height="800" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">1/8000 sec f4 ISO100</figcaption></figure> 

Playing with my flash using the High Speed Sync mode. I really like the way this came out, only wish I had wireless triggers to make it easier to set up. Really neat effect, cuts out a ton of the ambient light and darkens everything but what is lit by the flash. Of course, my attmept is only okay, but was fun anyway. Trying to try new stuff!<figure style="width: 800px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

<img title="Field Lines" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.kshermphoto.com/2009PostsImages/May/17/May17-001.jpg" alt="3rd Base line at Judsons baseball field" width="800" height="533" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">3rd Base line at Judson's baseball field. 1/4000 sec f4 ISO640</figcaption></figure> 

I love the colors on a baseball field. Maybe its a carryover from my lawn-mowing days, but the deep green of the field against the brown dirt with the bold white line make for a stellar combination in my book.<figure style="width: 800px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

<img title="Hurdling" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.kshermphoto.com/2009PostsImages/May/17/May17-002.jpg" alt="High Hurdles shot with a 400mm f2.8" width="800" height="533" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">High Hurdles shot with a 400mm f2.8. 1/2000 sec f2.8 ISO400</figcaption></figure> 

I was covering a track meet for VIP and met a photographer from the Daily Herald. Was a really cool guy and if he is any indication of the other photographers that work at the DH, this is going to be one heck of an internship! Only 8 days left to go too! He had a 400mm f2.8L that he let me shoot a few races with. This isn't one of the schools I was covering, just trying to get a feel for the lens. Truly amazing combination of glass and aluminum.<figure style="width: 800px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

<img title="Intersecting Lines" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.kshermphoto.com/2009PostsImages/May/17/May17-003.jpg" alt="Track Lines" width="800" height="414" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Track Lines. 1/2000 sec f2.8 ISO400</figcaption></figure> 

I shot a lot of Track and Field meetes these last few weeks. Quickly became one of my favorite sporting events to shoot. Such a variety of races, action and angles to shoot it keeps things interesting. The many line on the tracks have always held a degree of fascination in my mind; all the intersections, perpendicular and parallel lines, some bisected by curves, each lane labeled and measured for each specific event. Fascinating!

    Well, Spring 2009 has long come to an end; the end of my last full-time undergraduate semester. Was a tough one with a ton of work but managed to survive it all! Biggest accomplishment: I got an A- in Christian Theology, taught by Dr. Cosden. He is one tough essay grader, but I learned a TON in the class and I don't think my my life will be the same because of that class. Was a really good feeling getting through that semester. Now I am two-thirds of the way through a summer class, Group Discussion. As soon as the class is over I hit up on my Internship! So close to graduation. Let see what else this summer has to hold!
