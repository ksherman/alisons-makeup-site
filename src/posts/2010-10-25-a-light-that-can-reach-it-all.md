First time taking a shot at the moon! I&#8217;ve owned this 300mm f2.8L for a few weeks now, finally tossed it on my 5D Mark II, added on the 1.4x extender and gave it a shot. The combination is only about a 420mm which isn&#8217;t all that long for shooting the moon. This is nearly a 100% crop. Wish I could grab a 2x to stack just for fun!
