I didn&#8217;t take a whole lot of pictures this weekend, most likely because I was pretty distracted for most of the weekend. I have a really busy week ahead and I was preoccupied with trying to figure out how to get it all done.

Learned a goodly amount, but mostly I was excited about the people I met. I have about four Chicago-based photojournalists that offered to give me additional feedback of my images during my internship. That is gonna be amazing and in many ways well worth the cost of the conference. I also presented nine of my images from my coverage of Election Night 2008 in Chicago to a room full of incredible photographers. Crazy. Scott Strazzante from the Chicago Tribune helped me narrow down my pictures, which was great!

I am now exploding with excitement for my internship this summer. Insane.

Peace out all,
