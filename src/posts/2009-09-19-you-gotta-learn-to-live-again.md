Sports are back!

I really enjoy shooting sports, especially for the newpaper when you get shoot a pretty wide assortment of sports. With shooting action for VIP, the emphasis is really on quantity over quality, since their goal is to get a picture of everyone on the team. I understand that thinking, its not wrong.

But I prefer to be able to really concentrate on getting a few good shots from a lot of attempts. Over the summer, I didn&#8217;t get to shoot a lot of action, because there aren&#8217;t many sports going on in the summer (is it just me, or does that seem a little odd?). But now as the fall semester is in full swing, I will get to shoot a lot of action. Sweet.

My first assignment this morning was to cover summer ski jumping. Yes, apparently you can do ski jumping in the summer. Odd. Then it was on to Golf. Golf is fun to shoot, usually. At least at the High School level. Get to cruise around on a cart through some beautiful scenery. Too bad I&#8217;m no good at the sport :).<figure style="width: 544px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

Yay! Captions are back! I missed captioning pictures, really. Made posting here a little less exciting.

Lots going on at my jobs, but despite that I hope to really start putting together a decent galleries page, for those that note that the current one stinks and hasn&#8217;t been updated in a year&#8230; Not sure how to do it quite yet. All in time!

As always, thanks for stopping by!

Peace
