Also first time shooting Track and Field. So many things to shoot in a limited time frame. Tried some different things too. Some turned out really well. Took about 750 images, I just kept clicking away. Would love to do it again.

About my lost data sage, I have pretty much recovered everything. All my drives are now safe in a 5-bay eSATA enclosure. I'm only using three of the bays, gives me room to grow up in. There is about 3TB total in the enclosure. I also rearranged my office a bit, cleaned it up and organized it all. Makes me feel a lot better spending so much time here these days. It somehow feels like a brighter room now.

Thanks again,
