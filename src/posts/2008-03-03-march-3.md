So I ended up staying up all night to work on my stuff.

I only got about 70% or so of my manual done. Sucks. But there was soooo much information to process through. Should have freakin started it days ago.

And so I then had to put together a 20 min message in about 2hrs. I made the mistake of getting a coffee in the morning. Being usually slightly anxious before I speak (especially if I feel unprepared) + No sleep + Coffee = I felt really sick.

But I was hungry, so I turned to Saltines. I love those things. So good and you can eat them even when you feel sick :).

So strange that after only a 3 hour nap, I feel like I have so much energy.
