Some mo' pictures from awesome California.

The weather here (near the coast anyway) is amazing. I can totally see why some people come here and never leave.<figure style="width: 800px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

Not much else at this point! Still in limbo in surgery world. Been running around a bunch. So glad I still have a whole week left here.

Today's title is from the some "For You My Dear" by Steel Train from their album For You My Dear. My current obsession (on so many levels!).

> It takes a lot to really fake you and leave you bare  
> And I'll never forsake you
> 
> You can stand on the edge till you find the pledge you made  
> Once upon your stolen seeds  
> But to hold the dreams and never believe you'll leave all the schemes  
> That held you up inside
> 
> For you my dear  
> I can fall from heights
> 
> And it's all I can do  
> As I slide to you  
> And brake when we fall
> 
> I give it all the best for the girl who rests  
> Shameless on the brink of broken dreams  
> And so I look to the floor for the one I adore  
> And in place is the face that shines so bright I believe
> 
> Don't you turn away
> 
> Don't deny what makes you  
> And in me you'll see the one who'll forsake you
