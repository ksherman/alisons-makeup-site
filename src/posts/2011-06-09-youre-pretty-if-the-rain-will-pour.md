Sorry this a little on the older side! Making a stronger effort to get fresh content up here!

Final today for my graduate class called The Press and the Presidency. Loving this class, teacher is great and the content even more so. It has made me a little angry with modern news coverage of elections. But once this final is over, I'm done until September! I am so sick of essays <img src="http://kshermphoto.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" />

Lots going on, some new ideas are popping in my head!

Peace\
