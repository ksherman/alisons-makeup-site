I hope to try and stay on top of making new posts more often, still getting into the swing. Here in the third week I am more certain than ever that I want to do this for quite a long time. Nothing like a variety of opportunities to shoot, the different subjects and events.. and the other photographers I meet!

Before divulging into a long long set of softball photos, I have two graduations shots to share. So glad I didn&#8217;t have to do all that many of these. Kinda fun, but it gets old pretty quick.<figure style="width: 800px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

Okay. I&#8217;m bored with graduations already! This next set of images come from my first out-of-town assignment. I am (still) down at the EastSide Centre fields in East Peoria, IL covering the IHSA state softball tournament. Four games on Friday, two today. [I am in between the two today, I will probably have time after the game to update this here blag with some new images.] I come down with a sports writer from the DuPage office and I volunteered to drive so I could at least make some money from the weekends adventure (I only get my mileage reimbursed). To my surprise, here I spotted a photographer I met back at the SWPJC I went to in February.<figure style="width: 800px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

Yes, The Great Scott [Strazzante]. A photographer for the Tribune that is quite talented. Really great guy to talk to too. Check him out on his [blag][1] and if you are interested, [here][2] is a gallery with his images from the weekend. The whole gallery is not his, but the most recent stuff is in the beginning, so he first two dozen or so are his. Yes, he rocks my face off. Nice work Scott <img src="http://kshermphoto.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />

Now on to my [less good] softball shots. This so only a few shots from each of the games, enjoy!<figure style="width: 533px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

Well, if you have been reading the captions (you have been, right?) then you would see that indeed all four teams I covered lost. Stinks. Fortunately, that means I get to leave &#8216;early&#8217; tonight since I don&#8217;t have to cover the Class 4A final game at 7pm. In fact, the last two games my teams did not get a single hit. Means the action was at a relative minimum. But, this is high school so there is always a second chance! Well, for third place there is. So here is this morning&#8217;s Class 3A third place game.<figure style="width: 800px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
