Crazy day! My wife got locked out of the house briefly with the baby inside, so naturally she went all &#8220;Jack Bauer&#8221; on our front door.

I got a last minute call to shoot the Sears Holdings Headquarters in Hoffman Estates for the cover of tomorrow&#8217;s (Sept. 30) Elgin Courier News. Awesome. Had a hard time getting to a good spot on the building, but I ended up getting there at the exact right moment. I&#8217;m super excited about the results, barely did any editing on these. First one is my favorite.

Thanks for looking! I snap a picture of the front page and post it tomorrow <img src="http://kshermphoto.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />

[UPDATE]  
Here it is!
