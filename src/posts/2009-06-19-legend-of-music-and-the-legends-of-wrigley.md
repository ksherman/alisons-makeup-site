New post time! Been a few days behind on getting some of these up. Got some time now! Went to shot a rehearsal for a local production called the Legends of Music. I kind of liked some of the shots I got from it which is great because it was a hard situation to shoot it.<figure style="width: 800px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

And now. The Legends of Wrigley. Well they aren't all legends, but I got to shoot the Cubs vs. Sox game this past Wednesday. Was quite the experience, but I wish I could have shot at different locations, which isn't really possible at Wrigley Field. So here it is.<figure style="width: 800px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

As usual, thanks for stopping by! I also added a new feature to my blog. If you try to come here on a mobile phone (any, blackberry, iPhone, palm etc) my wedsite will automatically resize the pictures and font to fit on you phone! The result is a page that loads a TON faster for you and doesn't require any work on my end :-). And it was free! Check out Mobify.me for details.

I also got accepted onto SportsShooter.com! Its a semi-tough place to gain membership to, all applications have to submit a portfolio of 10 images and then are approved or denied based on those images. I finally decided that I had enough good stuff with captions to go ahead and apply. And I got accepted!

Well, off to start another day at the Daily Herald! Maybe I will get assigned to watch out for Spiderman, hint hint <img src="http://kshermphoto.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";-)" class="wp-smiley" />

Peace,
