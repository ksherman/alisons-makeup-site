Video time! I&#8217;ve been working on this for over a week, in my spare (ha!) time. First thing I&#8217;ve put together using footage from my 7D. There is about 10 or 12 things I would have done differently knowing what I know now&#8230; But I guess that&#8217;s learning!



[Meals for Haiti][1] from [Kevin Sherman][2] on [Vimeo][3].

Filmed during an event managed by the Salvation Army in Elgin to pack 1,000,000 meals for relief efforts in Haiti. Each meal feeds six people.

Shot with a Canon EOS 7D, 16-35L and 70-200L IS.

Edited in Adobe Premiere Pro and title text done in Adobe After Effects.

Let me know what you think. I&#8217;m by no means a video expert or professional, just takin&#8217; a stab at something new. I&#8217;d write more, but I&#8217;m super tired. Long day.

Oh, and I love the duo of Adobe After Effects and Adobe Premiere Pro. I &#8216;lol&#8217; at Final Cut Studio.

Today&#8217;s title comes from the song &#8220;You Gotta Believe&#8221; by The Rocket Summer from his latest album Of Men and Angels. I just downloaded this album this afternoon and I absolutely love it!
