Seems the cool photographers get to post &#8216;reject' photos, or ones you wouldn't normally submit for an assignment. I want to be cool, so I saw something interesting and m sharing it. Cuz I'm cool too.

There were a lot of kids in the balcony overlooking the sectional final volleyball game I shot tonight. It caught my eye, just this one head popping out further than the rest.

I've actually been shooting a TON lately, but a lot of it has been for Judson so it's not in my normal image workflow, ergo I tend to forget about them.

That's all for now. I REALLY need to finish my homework, I'm already a week behind. Though that might have to do with the fact that I got all four bit of wisdom ripped from my head a week ago and am battling a dry socket and 8 of the largest canker sores ever.

Today's title was taken from Angels and Airwaves "The Flight of Apollo" from their album _Love, Part 1_. I can't stop listening to this album and Thriving Ivory's _Through Yourself and Back Again_.
