Seems the cool photographers get to post &#8216;reject&#8217; photos, or ones you wouldn&#8217;t normally submit for an assignment. I want to be cool, so I saw something interesting and m sharing it. Cuz I&#8217;m cool too.

There were a lot of kids in the balcony overlooking the sectional final volleyball game I shot tonight. It caught my eye, just this one head popping out further than the rest.

I&#8217;ve actually been shooting a TON lately, but a lot of it has been for Judson so it&#8217;s not in my normal image workflow, ergo I tend to forget about them.

That&#8217;s all for now. I REALLY need to finish my homework, I&#8217;m already a week behind. Though that might have to do with the fact that I got all four bit of wisdom ripped from my head a week ago and am battling a dry socket and 8 of the largest canker sores ever.

Today&#8217;s title was taken from Angels and Airwaves &#8220;The Flight of Apollo&#8221; from their album *Love, Part 1*. I can&#8217;t stop listening to this album and Thriving Ivory&#8217;s *Through Yourself and Back Again*.
