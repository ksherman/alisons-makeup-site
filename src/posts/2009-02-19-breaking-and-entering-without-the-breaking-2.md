Well, I am a it again: musing about possbily buying a house. It could be amazing, or it could be a huge mistake&#8230; I found this sweet house in Elgin, near the Centre that is currently listed at $119k. The place needs quite a bit of work. It was built in 1875, so its an old house for sure. The doors were unlocks (and technically didn&#8217;t have any bolts, so you can just push the doors open) so I went in this morning on got some pixels.<figure style="width: 800px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

The house goes to auction next Tuesday, but from the information I have gathered, its not really an auction but more a ploy to get people to see the house and put in offers.

Despite the work, I can really see it being a pretty awesome place once we can sink money into it. My hope is to get the house for around $60k, then put between $20-30k into it. I dunno.. I&#8217;m excited at the possbility, at the opportunity to fix up a place that is my own, to have a place that is my own&#8230; The work is intimidating. But I keep thinking how good that place would look; it makes me excited!<figure style="width: 459px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

<img title="Damaged Ceiling" src="http://gallery.me.com/ksherman_86/100212/IMG_0103/web.jpg" alt="Water leak in the roof is leaking through the floors.

The biggest problem is that the roof seems to be leaking, which has leaked through the 2nd floor ceiling, through the 2nd floor and then into the ceinling of the 1st floor. There could be mold, which is no bueno.<figure style="width: 459px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

<img title="2nd Floor Hallway" src="http://gallery.me.com/ksherman_86/100212/IMG_0108/web.jpg" alt="These old houses all seem to have narrow hallways. This is the hallway in the second floor. " width="459" height="800" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">These old houses all seem to have narrow hallways. This is the hallway in the second floor. </figcaption></figure> 

This place has 6 bedrooms, a living room, dining room and front room. Nice size kitchen with decent cabinets. Big, clean basement. Sweet stair case. Its just such a cool place!<figure style="width: 459px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
