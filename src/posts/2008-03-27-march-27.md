Man, I need a proper Macro lens again&#8230;

So what is the secret to taking different pictures everyday? Maybe I am just to busy to find something interesting to shoot.

Today&#8217;s features the latest and last upgrade to my MacBook Pro. Over the weekend, I replaced the 120GB internal drive, which is too cramped for me, for a foxy 320GB drive. It rocks.

So now really, there aren&#8217;t any more possible upgrades for my lappy. Well, technically there is one where you can replace the DVD drive for a second hard drive. Worth considering some day in the future. I barely use the thing any way <img src="http://kshermphoto.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" />

Peace.
