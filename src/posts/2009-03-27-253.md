Hey Campers!

I know it has been way too long since my last update, I still have been trying to get a moment to catch up on the mounds of pictures I need to get through&#8230;

So in lieu, this is a project for my Storytelling class. Our assignment was to tell a story using only pictures. This is a slightly different version than the one played in class, I modified the clip lengths and made the video significantly shorter.

The beginning and ending are weak at this point, I had to shot those parts all on my own which is really really hard to do and to do it well. The concept here is that for me, the brief moments of initial consciousness in the morning generally gives me a very warped concept of time. Therefore the opening shots are of me essentially checking my calendar and seeing that I have a job interview the next day and I am setting an alarm. I then wake up the next morning to find that I am running really late etc etc. At the end, it turns out it is actually 6:30am not 8:30am and so I hit the snooze button on my alarm.

Thanks for watching and let me know what you think!I promise more things will be posted as I get through them!
