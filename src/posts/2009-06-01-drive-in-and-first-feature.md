Happy June!! So today there was not a whole lot to do in the office. Went through some photos from an assignment on Saturday night at a Drive-in movie theatre in McHenry, IL. I guess I can throw a few of those your way. I found out today that several of my images will be used for this article in the Time Out! section of the Daily Herald this up-coming Friday. Sick!<figure style="width: 800px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

Then, with nothing really happening in the office, they sent me out Feature hunting. Or Wild Art hunting. Or Standalone hunting. They keep changing the name on me... Basically, these are pictures that do not have a story attached to them and are usually used on either Page 1 or 3 (likely 3). I am essentially supposed to wander around a given area and find something/someone interesting to shoot. Yes, its is a whole ton creepier than it sounds. After my first two ideas being a bust (way too complicated family structure and a lot of Polish brick layers who kept sending my into empty buildings when I asked if they had a formen or super intendant) I drove past a little forest preserve off the Fox River. There was an older couple over looking the river watching the fish try to get up the dam. Quite entertaining.<figure style="width: 800px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

Are you reading the captions? I worked hard to write those! Hard than taking the pictures, at least in my opinion. Time for the "weekend" and by "weekend" I mean the two days in the middle of the week were I work somewhere else. Oh, and I get old tomorrow. Rawk.

Peace,
