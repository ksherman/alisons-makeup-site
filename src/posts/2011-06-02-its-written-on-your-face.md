This is a few weeks late, but Annabellais now a little over a month old! It&#8217;s crazy how much time flies, how quickly things change and how quickly everything continues changing. Personally, I think it&#8217;s a fun ride, especially when you have your best friend beside you to take on the world. And heck, I turned 25 today! A good age, I think.

Today&#8217;s title is from &#8220;On the Other Side&#8221; on my current obsession album, Augustana&#8217;s latest self-titled.

> I don&#8217;t know where the ocean meets the sky  
> I don&#8217;t know why the world keeps spinning by  
> Don&#8217;t know why the hours move so slow  
> Babe, when I&#8217;m with you, I don&#8217;t want to know  
> Want to feel your feet lifting off the ground  
> I want to feel you love me at the speed of sound  
> Babe it could end tonight  
> Know it would be alright  
> Cuz I&#8217;m gonna love you  
> Somewhere on the other side
