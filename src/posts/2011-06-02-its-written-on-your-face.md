This is a few weeks late, but Annabellais now a little over a month old! It's crazy how much time flies, how quickly things change and how quickly everything continues changing. Personally, I think it's a fun ride, especially when you have your best friend beside you to take on the world. And heck, I turned 25 today! A good age, I think.

Today's title is from "On the Other Side" on my current obsession album, Augustana's latest self-titled.

> I don't know where the ocean meets the sky\
> I don't know why the world keeps spinning by\
> Don't know why the hours move so slow\
> Babe, when I'm with you, I don't want to know\
> Want to feel your feet lifting off the ground\
> I want to feel you love me at the speed of sound\
> Babe it could end tonight\
> Know it would be alright\
> Cuz I'm gonna love you\
> Somewhere on the other side
